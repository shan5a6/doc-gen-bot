Here is a professionally written README.md file for the provided Terraform code:
```
**Overview**

This Terraform infrastructure code provisions a basic AWS VPC and subnet using Terraform. The infrastructure is designed to provide a secure and isolated environment for deploying applications.

**Key Resources**

* **aws_vpc**: Main VPC with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`
* **aws_subnet**: Public subnet with a CIDR block of `10.0.1.0/24` and availability zone `us-west-2a`

**How to Use**

1. Install Terraform on your machine.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the workspace.
3. Run `terraform apply` to provision the infrastructure.
4. Verify the infrastructure has been provisioned by running `terraform output` to view the VPC and subnet IDs.

**Important Notes**

* The code uses default values for the `aws_region`, `vpc_cidr`, `public_subnet_cidr`, and `availability_zone` variables. You can override these values by setting environment variables or passing them as command-line arguments to Terraform.
* The code assumes you have the AWS CLI configured on your machine and have the necessary credentials set up.
* The code uses AWS provider version `~> 3.0` and Terraform version `~> 1.1.0`.

**Assumptions**

* You have a basic understanding of Terraform and AWS.
* You have the necessary permissions to create infrastructure in your desired AWS region.

**Troubleshooting**

* If you encounter issues provisioning the infrastructure, check the Terraform logs and AWS CloudFormation console for any errors or warnings.
* If you need to modify the infrastructure, edit the Terraform code and re-run `terraform apply`.
