Here is a professional and clear README.md file based on the provided Terraform code:

**Infrastructure and Pipeline Overview**

This Terraform configuration provisions an AWS VPC, subnet, and associated resources. The pipeline is designed to create a basic network infrastructure for a cloud-based application. The VPC and subnet can be customized using variables.

**Key Resources**

* `aws_vpc.main`: Creates a VPC with the specified CIDR block.
* `aws_subnet.public`: Creates a public subnet with the specified CIDR block and availability zone.

**Variables**

* `aws_region`: The AWS region to deploy to (default: `us-west-2`).
* `vpc_cidr`: The CIDR block for the VPC (default: `10.0.0.0/16`).
* `public_subnet_cidr`: The CIDR block for the public subnet (default: `10.0.1.0/24`).
* `availability_zone`: The availability zone for the subnet (default: `us-west-2a`).

**How to Use/Deploy**

1. Set environment variables or create a `terraform.tfvars` file with the desired values for the variables.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
3. Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create the resources.

**Important Notes**

* Ensure you have the necessary AWS credentials set up on your machine.
* This configuration assumes you are deploying to the specified region and availability zone. If you want to deploy to a different region or availability zone, update the `aws_region` and `availability_zone` variables accordingly.
* This is a basic configuration and you may want to customize it further to suit your specific needs.
* After deploying, ensure that the VPC and subnet are properly configured for your application's requirements.

By following these steps and noting the important assumptions and limitations, you can successfully deploy and use this infrastructure and pipeline.
