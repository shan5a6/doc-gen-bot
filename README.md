Here is a professional, clear README.md based on the provided Terraform code:

# Infrastructure Automation for AWS VPC and Subnet

This Terraform infrastructure automation script creates a VPC and a public subnet in AWS. The infrastructure is designed to be highly available and scalable, and can be easily extended to support additional resources and applications.

**Overview**
------------

This script creates the following resources:

* A VPC with a CIDR block specified in the `vpc_cidr` variable (default: `10.0.0.0/16`)
* A public subnet within the VPC with a CIDR block specified in the `public_subnet_cidr` variable (default: `10.0.1.0/24`)
* The public subnet is associated with the availability zone specified in the `availability_zone` variable (default: `us-west-2a`)

**Key Resources**
----------------

* AWS VPC: `aws_vpc.main`
* AWS Subnet: `aws_subnet.public`

**Variables**
------------

* `aws_region`: The AWS region to deploy to (default: `us-west-2`)
* `vpc_cidr`: The CIDR block for the VPC (default: `10.0.0.0/16`)
* `public_subnet_cidr`: The CIDR block for the public subnet (default: `10.0.1.0/24`)
* `availability_zone`: The availability zone for the public subnet (default: `us-west-2a`)

**How to Use/Deploy**
--------------------

1. Install Terraform on your machine.
2. Initialize the Terraform working directory by running `terraform init`.
3. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure.
4. Verify the infrastructure has been created by running `terraform show`.

**Important Notes/Assumptions**
-----------------------------

* This script assumes you have an AWS account with the necessary permissions to create a VPC and subnet.
* You can modify the variables to suit your specific infrastructure needs.
* This script only creates the VPC and public subnet, and does not include any other resources (e.g. EC2 instances, RDS databases, etc.).
