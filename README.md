Here is a professional, clear README.md for the provided Terraform code:

**Infrastructure Deployment using Terraform**
==============================================

**Overview**
----------

This Terraform configuration deploys a basic AWS infrastructure consisting of a VPC, subnet, and related resources. The infrastructure is designed for a development or testing environment and can be easily extended or modified to meet specific requirements.

**Key Resources**
----------------

* **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`.
* **Public Subnet**: A public subnet with a CIDR block of `10.0.1.0/24` and availability zone `us-west-2a`.

**How to Use/Deploy**
-------------------

### Prerequisites

* Terraform installed and configured on your machine.
* AWS credentials set up on your machine using the AWS CLI.

### Deployment

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform workspace.
3. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure.

### Variables

The following variables can be overridden using command-line flags or a `terraform.tfvars` file.

* `aws_region`: The AWS region to deploy to (default: `us-west-2`).
* `vpc_cidr`: The CIDR block for the VPC (default: `10.0.0.0/16`).
* `public_subnet_cidr`: The CIDR block for the public subnet (default: `10.0.1.0/24`).
* `availability_zone`: The availability zone for the subnet (default: `us-west-2a`).

**Important Notes and Assumptions**
--------------------------------

* This infrastructure configuration is designed for a development or testing environment and may not meet the requirements for a production environment.
* The VPC and subnet are not isolated from each other, and all resources are public-facing.
* The availability zone is set to `us-west-2a` by default, but this can be overridden using the `availability_zone` variable.
