Here is a professional, clear README.md file based on the provided Terraform code:

**Infra and Pipeline README**

**Overview**
This Terraform infrastructure code defines a single VPC with a public subnet in a specific AWS region. The VPC is configured with a CIDR block and the public subnet is also configured with a CIDR block and an availability zone.

**Key Resources**

* `aws_vpc.main`: The main VPC resource with a CIDR block and name tag "MainVPC".
* `aws_subnet.public`: The public subnet resource with a CIDR block, availability zone, and name tag "PublicSubnet".

**Variables**

* `aws_region`: The AWS region to deploy to (default: us-west-2).
* `vpc_cidr`: The CIDR block for the VPC (default: 10.0.0.0/16).
* `public_subnet_cidr`: The CIDR block for the public subnet (default: 10.0.1.0/24).
* `availability_zone`: The availability zone for the subnet (default: us-west-2a).

**How to Use/Deploy**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
2. Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` with the following contents:
```terraform
aws_region = "<your_aws_region>"
vpc_cidr = "<your_vpc_cidr>"
public_subnet_cidr = "<your_public_subnet_cidr>"
availability_zone = "<your_availability_zone>"
```
Replace `<your_aws_region>`, `<your_vpc_cidr>`, `<your_public_subnet_cidr>`, and `<your_availability_zone>` with your desired values.

3. Run the following command to apply the Terraform configuration:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
4. Verify the resources have been created by running:
```
terraform state list
```
**Important Notes and Assumptions**

* Make sure to replace the default values for `aws_region`, `vpc_cidr`, `public_subnet_cidr`, and `availability_zone` with your desired values in the `terraform.tfvars` file.
* Ensure you have the required AWS credentials set up on your machine.
* This code is designed to work with Terraform 1.x and AWS provider 4.x.
* This code does not include any dependencies or outputs beyond the VPC and public subnet creation.
