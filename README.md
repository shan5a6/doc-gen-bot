Here is a professional and clear README.md based on the provided Terraform code:

**Infrastructure Deployment README**

**Overview**
-----------

This Terraform configuration deploys a basic AWS infrastructure for a development or testing environment. The infrastructure includes a VPC, a public subnet, and all necessary resources to get started with your AWS setup.

**Key Resources**
----------------

* **VPC**: `aws_vpc.main` - A VPC with CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16` and tags `{ Name = "MainVPC" }`
* **Public Subnet**: `aws_subnet.public` - A public subnet with CIDR block `10.0.1.0/24` and availability zone `us-west-2a`, tagged as `PublicSubnet`

**How to Use/Deploy**
--------------------

To deploy this infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure Terraform on your machine.
2. Update the `variables.tf` file with your preferred AWS region (default: `us-west-2`), VPC CIDR block (default: `10.0.0.0/16`), public subnet CIDR block (default: `10.0.1.0/24`), and availability zone (default: `us-west-2a`).
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
4. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure to your AWS account.

**Important Notes/Assumptions**
------------------------------

* This configuration assumes you have an AWS account with the necessary permissions to create VPCs and subnets.
* The VPC CIDR block and public subnet CIDR block should not overlap with any existing CIDR blocks in your AWS account.
* The availability zone should be changed according to your specific requirements and availability zone preferences.
* This is a basic example and should be modified to fit your specific use case, such as adding security groups, route tables, and other resources as needed.
