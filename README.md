**README.md**

**Overview**

This Terraform configuration deploys a simple AWS infrastructure comprising a VPC and a public subnet. The infrastructure is optimized for a development environment and can be easily modified for production use.

**Key Resources**

* `aws_vpc.main`: The main VPC resource, which defines the VPC's CIDR block and is assigned the name "MainVPC".
* `aws_subnet.public`: The public subnet resource, which defines the public subnet's CIDR block, availability zone, and is assigned the name "PublicSubnet".

**How to Use/Deploy**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Update the `variables.tf` file to set your desired values for:
	* `aws_region`: The AWS region to deploy to (default: `us-west-2`).
	* `vpc_cidr`: The CIDR block for the VPC (default: `10.0.0.0/16`).
	* `public_subnet_cidr`: The CIDR block for the public subnet (default: `10.0.1.0/24`).
	* `availability_zone`: The availability zone for the subnet (default: `us-west-2a`).
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
4. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure.
5. Once deployed, you can verify the infrastructure using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

**Important Notes**

* This infrastructure is designed for a development environment and is not suitable for production use without additional security and cost optimization measures.
* Make sure to update the `variables.tf` file with your desired values before deploying to a production environment.
* This Terraform configuration assumes that you have the AWS CLI and Terraform installed on your local machine.
