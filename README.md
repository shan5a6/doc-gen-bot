**Infrastructure README**

**Overview**

This infrastructure code uses Terraform to create an AWS VPC with a public subnet. It provides a basic foundation for deploying resources in a secure and isolated environment. The code defines variables for the AWS region, VPC CIDR block, public subnet CIDR block, and availability zone.

**Key Resources**

* `aws_vpc.main`: The main VPC with a CIDR block of `var.vpc_cidr` (default: `10.0.0.0/16`).
* `aws_subnet.public`: The public subnet with a CIDR block of `var.public_subnet_cidr` (default: `10.0.1.0/24`) and availability zone `var.availability_zone` (default: `us-west-2a`).

**How to Use/Deploy**

1. Create a new Terraform workspace or update an existing one.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the workspace.
3. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure.

**Important Notes/Assumptions**

* Make sure to update the `aws_region` variable to your desired AWS region.
* Update the `vpc_cidr`, `public_subnet_cidr`, and `availability_zone` variables as needed for your specific use case.
* This is a basic example and does not include security groups, route tables, or other resources that may be necessary for a production environment.
* Terraform variables are defined in the `variables.tf` file. You can update these variables using the `terraform` command or by creating a `terraform.tfvars` file with the desired values.
* This code uses AWS provider version 3.63.0. Make sure to update the AWS provider version in your `provider.tf` file to match the version that you have installed.
